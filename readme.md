# Intro to R

This is a set of scripts with comments that can walk you through getting started with R. If you have a specific topic, it will be listed in the title of the script.

## Downloading the scripts

Go to [the git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download git for the relevant operating system. Then open up git bash (an application that will be installed with git), and run

```
cd directory/to/copy/to
```
and then run

```
git clone https://github.com/be-green/intro-to-r.git
```

There will then be a sub-folder in your directory called /intro-to-r that contains all of the relevant scripts.
